**Repository - ESG Analysis**

This repository contains code with temporal analysis of the language used by 3 leading UK energy companies around their ESG initiatives.

INTRODUCTION-

Companies are being held to better standards through the years around their sustainability initiatives. This analysis aims to look at the language used by 3 UK energy companies around their sustainability initiatives. We explore data from 3 sources-
1. Annual Reports (2020-2022)
2. Sustainability Reports (2020-2022)
3. Websites

Data was gathered through web scraping of all sustainability-related web links for these 3 companies, and was further enriched by their annual and sustainability reports.

Exploratory Data Analysis 1 - Word Count Plot

I wanted to quickly visualise the most common words used within the data sources, and hence, have created a Word Count Plot where the size of the word shows its prevalence. This data has been normalised using the overall word counts of these web links.
Recurring words used across all data sources for all three companies include 'energy', 'emission', 'sustainability', 'performance', 'report', 'safety' etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis 2 - Bubble Plots

I wanted to look at how words have been used within company websites, and the prevalence of key ESG-related wording through a bubble plot.

Exploratory Data Analysis 3 - Temporal line graphs

I wanted to look at how words have increased or decreased in prevalence over the 3-year period within annual reports and sustainability reports as a reaction to growing conversations of companies greenwashing their performance through language.
